// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Gather what 2 numbers you would like to find the sum of.
Input the Data into formula X+Y=Z
Variable Positions are interchangable for Addition problems.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take Variable Z and divide by 2.
If remainder is ZERO print Even
Remainder is anything but zero print ODD

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)Enter 5 separate numbers
(3) (6) (12) (68) (74)
Numbers will be given variables of A-E
b)Calculate sum of entered variables then divde by 5
c)Test all variables against each other i.e A<B 
print results
d)Average of Data set is 32.6
Minimum of data set is 3, Maximum of data set is 74
